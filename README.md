# My Application

Live on Netlify: //TODO will be added

## Get Started

Install: `npm i`

Development: `npm run dev`

Build: `npm run build`

## Which Browsers/Devices or Virtualisation services did you check the application in?

Latest version of Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Microsoft Edge on desktop Mac.

Latest version of Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari on iOS.

## Anything you want to tell us?

I used React.js and webpack to get the things done faster.

### Dependencies

I used React.js as the main framework to render the UI and manage app state. In addition to the basics, I added these dependencies:

- [@react-hook/media-query](https://github.com/jaredLunde/react-hook/tree/master/packages/media-query#readme), to manage easily a MatchMedia callback;
- [react-toastify](https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify), as I hade short time and it was too long to develop this kind of component by myself;
- [remove-focus-outline](https://github.com/lindsayevans/outline.js), beacuse it's simple, easy and improve UX and accessibility at almost no cost.

Moreover, I used [sass-mq](https://github.com/sass-mq/sass-mq) to easily manage breakpoints in styles.

## How would you improve this test?

#### 1. Getting visual

I'd like the idea to add an effect to show the product image while hovering each row: images can really give a spin to a UI.

#### 2. Testing the test

Moreover, If I had a lot of time, I'd study something about code testing practices to answer to your requests.

## What did you think of this test/exercise?

This exercise gave me a lot of learning on the way. This task is good exercise of React hooks.

### What did you like?

#### 1. The hidden complexities of UI interaction

I liked the fact that an apparently simple page presented a lot of small challenges, not immediately noticeable, that allowed me to test react.js. I wanted to test how difficult would have been to transfer Vue.js concepts to it and I think it was an ideal reduced case.

#### 2. The blooming of UX opportunities

I liked having to think about the UX of a very small part of an hypothetical user flow: it reminded me how many improvement we can think of.

#### 3. The opportunity for gratitude

I liked to work directly with webpack: it reminded me how powerful it is and... How lucky we are for all the open-source tools that save us the time to configure it!
